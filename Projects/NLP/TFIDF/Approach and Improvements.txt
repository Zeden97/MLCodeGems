#Approach:
Used very simple approach since use of NLP libraries was not allowed
1) Preprocess:	Take each document in the corpus remove non alphanumeric char
2) TfIDF vector: Generate TfIdf vector of each document 
   Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf
3) Similarity : Use cosine similarity on TfIDF vectors to find simialr document

#Improvements:

1) Improve TfIDF by
   a) By removing stopwords (using NLTK library)
   b) By stemming or lemmatization of word (using NLTK library)

2) Use Solr (This approach is highly scalable):
   a) Ingest all documents to Solr 
   b) Do keyword based search using keywords of new document
   c) Return top N results from Solr

3) Using Deep Learning approach (doc2vec):
   a) Generate doc2vec from gensim doc2vec library.
   b) Using most_similar function (of doc2vec) to find topn documents

4) Use ensemble of two or more approaches discussed above.
